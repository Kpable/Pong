Two paddles, one ball, classic fun. 
#### Purpose
As an introduction to the world of game development, I took on the challenge to try to remake a simple and familiar game. 
#### Game State
Complete. Woooo! 
#### Status
Continuously fighting the feature creep.
#### Progress
The game is complete and playable. It can be played in single and local multiplayer modes. I lost to the feature creep with the multiplayer functionality.

#### Remarks
This was fun. I had just started learning Unity3D and gave a shot a rapid prototyping. Rushing code out without too much of a plan was exhilarating (I know that most definitely doesn't work most of the time.. long since learned that the "fun" way). Feature creep did ultimately play a role in the game when I decided to add in local multiplayer.
